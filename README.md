# charis_ocs

These are the files describing the CHARIS instrument to Subaru OCS system. The structure is 
intended to be used as directory named "CHARIS".

This started as a git sub-module for Subaru OCS, but in 2021-05 we decoupled that. Subaru will fork this repo, and submit pull requests as needed.
